# Codify v1.0 :collision: :grey_exclamation:

### About :thought_balloon:

Codify is an _**Online Interface**_ for code evaluation. It executes the code submitted by user and displays the result back to the user.

### How it works :question:

Codify uses __[Judge0](https://api.judge0.com/) API__ to evaluate code and displays the result obtained from the API. Hence, it is __only an interface__.
It also supports functions like __uploading questions along with testcases__ to the platform, __ranks__ based on number of questions solved and __an IDE__ to run code.
